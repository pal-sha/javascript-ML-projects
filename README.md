# javascript-ML-projects

This repository contains all the small Javascript ML projects I have been working on. I will keep on updating it as I work on more. If a project becomes larger as I progress to more advanced levels, I will move the code to a separate repo and link it here. 

Detailed project descriptions will be added soon...
